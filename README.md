<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites and Installation

Make sure you have node.js as well as the basic npm functions downloaded on your end.
If this node module needs anything specific to run locally know that note that your computer will probably have to download it locally. The only plugins used are

antd
react
http-proxy-middleware
axios

do `npm install react-scripts`

In the server src/server directory Run `npm start` to create an instance of a local host
Make sure in the package.json the instance of "scripts": { "start": "react-scripts start", "build": "react-scripts build", "test": "react-scripts test", "eject": "react-scripts eject" },
Is there to make sure that npm start is converted into npm react-scripts start

If not add it or run `npm react-scipts start`


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

## Running Sentiment Analysis

You can view the tests for this branch of code here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JEmG7M4BLVaegpEoqAs6XFxxKtGsbzmL?usp=sharing

## Webpage

The webpage in its current state is capable of running through the sis.api and using it to search up classes through running the sis.api through a middleware function setupProxy.js to convert into JSONP and then read the code through the App.js and Searchbar.js function and component respectively.

## Sentiment Analysis

The 'finetune_review_dataset.ipynb' finetunes the 'bert-base-cased' model on the 'coursera course review' dataset. The training of the model takes 4 hours to process.
The 'course_review_analyser.ipynb' imports the finetuned model we created above and runs it on the review input by the user. To run this file in current state, you can used Google Colab.
The output is a rating between 1 to 5 and the confidence of the model in that rating itself. This helps us understand the emotion of the reviewer and it can be analysed to give a final output on the website.
In the next iterations, this code will be attached to the backend so that the reviews uploaded on the website will be reviewed by the analyser automatically.
