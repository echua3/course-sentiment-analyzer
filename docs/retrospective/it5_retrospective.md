# Final Retrospective - Iteration 5 
## Team Sentience

## __Iteration 5 Accomplishments__
### Original Project Proposal
Our proposed project was to build a responsive web application which has a sentiment analysis engine that can be accessed using a mobile or a desktop computer. We aimed to provide students a place to give all their thoughts on a course. Our goal was to take that student input, and return an analysis of all the reviews through charts and graphs.

For students who want to learn more information about the course they are interested in, we aimed to provide a way they can search with keywords and filters and even post a question which has not been answered yet. The professor of a particular course can review and share his thoughts about the course he would teach. Their review will have a higher priority than the student reviews. The reviews can be upvoted or downvoted depending on how helpful they are. The most helpful reviews will have a higher priority and will show up on top of the screen.

Our Iteration 1 User Stories included:  
#### Must haves:
- As a user, I want to be able to search for courses using a search bar so that I can easily find the course that I am looking for.
- As a user, I want to be able to view all the reviews, so that I can learn about othersâ€™ experiences with a class.
- As a user, I want to be able to view numerical data as well as text-based information, so that reviews are easier and faster to understand
- As a developer, only previous or current students should be allowed to give a review, so this would prevent malafide reviews in our database
- As a user, there should be charts and Graph analysis based on information given through the sentiment analysis form (Might not need a certain sample size threshold for this specific analysis, because even one review could lead to a world of information), these graphs have to relate to different parts of the sentiment analysis form, so that the reviews could be digested in a different medium allowing us to compare courses and other selections properly.

#### Nice to have:
- As a user, I want to view an in-depth analysis of the reviews for a course, so that I can know what it will be like to take the class
- As a user, I want to see the most helpful reviews first, so that I can efficiently go through only the reviews that are relevant and not waste time reading unhelpful reviews
- As a user, I want to see recommended courses, so that I can more easily find courses that suit both my course requirements and preferences
- As a user, I want to access the site from any browser, so that I easily use the website on different devices.

### Changes to Proposal
- We focused on the course search and added a course recommendation feature based on the user's interests. We did not provide a professor role with higher priorities. We clarified that the votes are based on the helpfulness of the review, not necessarily agreement.

### Delivered
- We delivered all the must-haves and nice-to-haves from the iteration 1 SRS.
    - Course Search with filters
    - Course Summary
        - Add Review
        - View All Reviews
        - Helpfulness
        - Review Sentiment and Difficulty Chart
    - User Profile
        - View and Edit Profile Information and Interests
        - Edit/Delete Reviews
    - Recommendations

### Not Delivered
- We delivered all of our must-haves and nice-to-haves from the iteration 1 srs.
- Different roles based on student or professor. (from original proposal)

## Challenges
- in previous iterations, we had challenges with effectively working as a team and ensuring the deliverable was working before the deadline
    - to overcome this, we assigned tasks to every person for each iteration
- we had challenges with using GitHub properly, we dealt with this by learning how to make branches and use pull requests to make sure the main branch is always working
- JHU SSO integration, still in progress, worked with mentor, professor, and JHU IT
- Fixing bugs after identifying them:
    - challenges with showing correct charts when moving

## Reflection for Overall Project (if we could start at iteration 1)
- More planning and assigning tasks from the beginning 
- Have a more detailed timeline for the whole project with user stories and features
- Ask Mentor and Professor for help right away 
- Identify blockers and progress of each teammate more frequently 
- Possibly look into other projects formats, such as an Android app
