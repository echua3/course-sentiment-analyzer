- Error Issuing for valued backend information, when it comes to what we need to use to value efficiency

## Reflection for Iteration 4
- Communication on slack is improving slowly but surely. I think as long as we continue to improve, communication in iteration 4 will be where we want it to be.
- I think getting everyone on the same boat really helps push delivery efficiency. Team meetings should be focused on planning next steps.
- Definitely having a comprehensive plan helps. Allows everyone to know what's going on.
- We could assign tasks more clearly and ensure the independence of each task. Set earlier deadlines for each task.
