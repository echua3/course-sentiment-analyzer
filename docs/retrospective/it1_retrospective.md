# Retrospective Iteration 1
## Team Sentience 

## __Iteration 1 Accomplishments__
### Delivered
- We used the SIS API to create a website platform that allows the user to search for any course that has been offered at JHU through its course title or course number.  
- The website displays a table including the School, Course Code, Course Title, Credits, and the Instructor. 
- We trained a sentiment analyzer model. The 'finetune_review_dataset.ipynb' finetunes the 'bert-base-cased' model on the 'coursera course review' dataset. 
- The model outputs a rating between 1 to 5 and the confidence of the model in that rating itself.

### Not Delivered
- We delivered all of our goals for this iteration.


## Challenges
- Took hours to train the sentiment analyzer method.
- The iteration 1 deliverable came together at the last day, which was a little stressful. 
- Front end to back end challenges. Integration of the search function code with the webpage design. 

## Reflection for Iteration 2
- To do a better job as a team, we can better define and specify every person's role, especially in the final deliverable for that iteration. 
- We can update and push the github repository more often.
- Better utilize the project backlog by defining more specific tasks for each user story.
