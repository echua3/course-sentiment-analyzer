# Retrospective Iteration 2
## Team Sentience

## __Iteration 2 Accomplishments__
### Delivered
- We used MongoDB Features, including skip and limiting to some of the platform, in order to connect the back end to the front end service
- CR of CRUD feature completed, so individuals can now look up, and search up different courses as well as add their input to it using those different MongoDB features 
- Search function optimized, values added to personal database, we are no longer using the SIS Api
- Created filters for search functions in order to make it more customizable for the user
- Front-end made more pliable, files are sorted based on our reflections for Iteration 2
- Connection of Node.js API to the Front-End
- Basic CSS done for the project

### Not Delivered
- Lack of MongoDB support in the backend via Models and Schemas to make our lives easier
- Limit and Skip Function not working for the search routes in the back end

## Challenges
- Relearning a lot of concepts that have to do with MongoDB as the routes design kinda differs from what we knew 
- Time crunch with the final touches of the project, have to get into contact with our mentor more often
- Dealing with the route of multiple filter params.
- Proper use of github features as a team.

## Reflection for Iteration 3
- The project itself was more collaborative this time around of course with its faults but learning or strengths and weaknesses as a team all the same.
- Make use of the github branches to encorporate new features.
- Still a little bit hectic in terms of getting stuff turned in at the literal last minute which probably isn't for the best moving forward
- We need to validate the data moving forward, make sure they aren't throwing in things into the pot that could make the whole batch soil
- Much better on communication with the whole team! We got to keep that energy moving forward hopefully!
- Have a cohesive idea on the final product and have a plan on how exactly we are going to reach that end goal iteration by iteration.
